Well, I'm pursuing some CTF goals.
Totally derailed.
But, I am investigating my core reasons to program.
The burn out happened because of lack of this.

Nice.

** Back to Odin

Now that I had a taste of the "ground truth" (official specs), I feel more confident about navigating the uncertainties and vagueness of the world.
Also, Wikipedia has a lot of good resources on alternatives to The Box Model...
I probably need to improve my Google-fu.

I feel that I tend to underestimate CSS.
I've been thinking about this.
Webdev is HTML, CSS, and JS.
Instinctively, I think: JS is harder than HTML, that is harder than CSS.
But this is not the case---at least for me.
CSS has lots of intellectual demands:
- The official docs are declarative: they don't teach how to implement, but what they want as a result (from the browser implementers).
  This removes a lot of pressure that is usually present when defining a language (like JS and even HTML).
  The documentation is more vague, there are lots of exceptions.
  And what trips me up the most is the terminology.
  It all started in CSS1 with
  - For the background: ~background-color~
  - For the foreground: ~color~ (!)


This list goes on and on.
I belive it stems from the fact that the people involved with the development of CSS have a different mindset than what I'm used to when dealing with tech specs.
And this is probably good, because they are also developing an aspect that is normally difficult for programmers: make things look good.
And I've seen what CSS can do, and it's great.
Also, I've seen the latest developments in layout---this is what made me go to the specs, I couldn't believe The Box Model could be a thing they would settle on---and thank God they didn't!
During this journey I learned a lot about realistic expectations on webdev and stuff---including my own capabilities and limits.
The most important thing was to see that when I go slowly on a CSS exercise things tend to flow better, and quicker.
My initial impulse is to underestimate and get frustrated with the delay, lack of info... when I could just stop, take a deep breath, and dedicate some time to think.

Another curious development: my inner artist is coming out, sniffing the territory, and I catch myself sometimes thinking about ideas for websites.
This is cool!

** CSS1 Standard

See how things evolved is good when there is so much confusion in the terminology.

The margin collapse from the Box Model makes sense for typography, not graphics layout.
It was introduced at a time where you /maybe/ would add a picture to a page; a time where the page was thought as a /book/ or /newspaper/ page (but without ads, comic strips or other elements demanding a more sophisticated and precise layout engine).

It was also the /first/ major attempt at adding styles to a page.
/Style/ at that time was mainly choosing the text font, and color; background color or image.
And back then, many users had only access to text terminals, so the important part of the page for them was mainly the text, and its structure.

I keep going back and forth from the specs to ChatGPT.
ChatGPT is great to teach me about the historical context.
It also makes great parallels with newer versions, points out things that have changed over time.
And it agrees with me about the quirks---but also often gives plausible motivations at the time for the quirks.

I just found out that modern alternatives like Flex and Grid do not collapse margins.
Thank God for them.
But this is not screamed all over the web tutorials as I believe it should be.
Advices like:

#+begin_quote
Avoid using the box model for layout, use the flex model instead.
#+end_quote

Just finished reading it.
Very nice.
Lots of quirks.

The one thing I really think would be useful is: when setting a property valeu, being able to reference the /current/ value.
For instance: If I want to make the first letter of a paragraph twice as big, I could say something like:

#+begin_src css
p::first-letter {
  font-size: calc(current * 2);  /* or  '2*'  */
}
#+end_src

Or if I wanted it to be 10 pixels bigger:

#+begin_src css
p::first-letter {
  font-size: calc(current + 10px);
}
#+end_src

** CSS2.1 Standard

It mentions "webmasters" LOL.

Starts talking about JavaScript.

** CSS has some obscurities

The first one just appeared: The Box Model.
I'll try and be systematic here.

Reading CSS Standar Box Model.
https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box-3/

Again, much better.
Tutorials and books are hesitant about terminology and analogies.
Better go to the source.

First small joy: yes, everything in CSS is either a *box* or a *text sequence*.
CSS has its own tree, the *box tree*, derived from the DOM.

** I started reading CSS1 specs

Very enlightening.
Using ChatGPT to answer questions; usualy involve historical quirks.

** 1h coding

Today I really spent most of the time on the specs.
I also did lots of free explorations on the Dev Tools in Firefox, with the help of ChatGPT.
I'm counting those as coding; all in all, I feel today's work granted me that.

** Odin Foundations Course

Started reding the theory for The Box Model.

Went do MDN and ChatGPT for clarifications.

Downloading some CSS books for reference.

Just read some chapters of some CSS books.
Nice to see they have much more structure than several online resources---editorial pressure, probably.

Now, I need to *practice*.

** Burn out WARNING

Today I studied too much, didn't go busking, and didn't properly rest.

I'll work on my 1h coding now, and then rest.

** 1h of Hack!

I'll experiment with LP.
Two code blocks: HTML and JS.

First we tangle.

** Finished reading the HTML Standard (kind of)

Just finished reading the HTML Standard---skipping a lot of technical details.
Very interesting.
Funny to see the authors have a sense of humor :)

When I started reading, I wanted to

- Have a basic knowledge of all the elements
  - This was accomplished, as the Standard lists them all, with all the details.
- Learn how to do /responsive/ work with images
  - This was advanced, but I need to practice.
- Learn about Web Workers (and Worklets)
  - Idem.

** What now?

After reading the Standard, I still need to practice that knowledge.
I couldn't memorize each and every detail, so I need to apply to learn.
There are several good ways to learn, but I'll stick to Odin for now--- I'm invested.

** 1h of Coding

Wow!
Today another 1h of coding provided by our friend ChatGPT.
This time I had a harder time keeping up!
Couldn’t finish all the exercises in 1h.

** Seinfeld Checkmark

[[file:images/2025-10-05_seinfeld.jpeg]]

* [2025-10-04 Sat]

** Google's course

Today I wanna do something "risky": peak at [[https://web.dev/][Google's webdev course]].
I’m feeling curious about a lot of technical nuances and details, and kinda looking for some course that is a middle ground between /hands-on/-focused and /technical-standards/-focused.
The idea is to go over the curriculum, and then reflect.
When I was reading the HTML tech specs, I saw a lot of things that weren't covered on the tutorials; /cool/ things!
I don't know if I should focus on those specs first, or courses, or books.
But I believe a quick look at the curriculum can't hurt.
Let's do it!

The HTML Course is heavily based on the official HTML Standard, but, still, very /fragmented/, and sometimes /vague/.

** HTML Standard

I'm feeling /adventurous/.
Gonna give a peek at the Standard this weekend.

Just read the first 3 chapters; very /technical/---skipped a lot of details.
But the advantage I see is: /not/ consuming a piece of information is /voluntary/, as opposed to consuming third-party tutorials and courses, where they /decide/ which information to ommit.
The problem is: there are no /exercises/; I'll have to deal with that deficiency somehow; probably with tutorials and courses, but /after/ having a general idea of the whole shabang.

** Coding hour

I was half-intending to consider reading the HTML Standard as /valid coding/ for the 1h/day streak.
But... nah.
Then I tried to find something to code.
I want either Elisp or JavaScript.
JavaScript, for focus on current major learning goals.
Exercism, HackerRank, LeetCode, all very advanced problems.
Then asked ChatGPT for some, and this is what I got:

#+end_src

After I submitted my solutions, ChatGPT
- complimented the random color generator (Google's LOL)

  #+begin_quote
  Stylistic note
  Your random color generator is neat — padding the hex code was a smart touch! That’s something even many beginners forget.
  #+end_quote
- gave some stylistic and best practices that I didn't agree at first

  #+begin_quote
  Counter readability
  Instead of converting textContent back and forth each click, you could keep a separate variable:
  #+end_quote

  #+begin_src js
  let counter = 0;
  function updateCounter() {
    leCounterP.textContent = counter;
  }
  leCounterButtonPlus.addEventListener("click", () => {
    counter++;
    updateCounter();
  });
  leCounterButtonMinus.addEventListener("click", () => {
    counter--;
    updateCounter();
  });
  updateCounter();
  #+end_src

  My version is more compact, but looks clumsier.
  I could have also done away with the ~`...`~, as it accepts numbers.

  #+begin_src js
  leCounterButtonPlus.addEventListener("click", function () {
      leCounterP.textContent = `${Number(leCounterP.textContent) + 1}`;
  });
  leCounterButtonMinus.addEventListener("click", function () {
      leCounterP.textContent = `${Number(leCounterP.textContent) - 1}`;
  });
  #+end_src



Learned another one!

Surprisingly, it took me just about one hour to do those!
Good on you, ChatGPT!

** Seinfeld Checkmark

* [2025-10-03 Fri]
Today I start a new lesson, and a new branch on the assignment tree: /Cascade/, the *C* from CSS.
Just read the lesson text, and now am complementing with the Wikipedia article.
I realized that the more formal texts (like standards) work better for me.
Maybe it's because I like the /raw/ info/rules, and then make my own analogies.

Doing some clean-up on the 02-... assignment.
Also did some cleanup for the other assignments (portfolios should be good looking!)

** 01-cascade-fix
Finished this one today.
It was about that apparently bothers devs a lot: find out the culprit for unexpected styling behavior.
I like that type of mental game!

** Seinfeld Checkmark

[[file:images/2025-10-03_seinfeld.jpeg]]

* [2025-10-02 Thu]

Check out the links for each exercise, with all the action [[https://github.com/rafaelbeirigo/odin-css-exercises][here]].

** 02-class-id-selectors
Just finished second CSS Assignment, and added a checkmark to the [[https://github.com/rafaelbeirigo/odin-css-exercises/tree/main][main README of the tasks]].
This one I had to fix a minor detail after finishing it, and then looking at the recommended solution.
I didn't catch one shared property among elements, which could make code legibility and maintenance much easier.
Learned another one!

Now, out to busking, and later some more!

** 03-grouping-selectors
Back from busking, very tired.
But ready to code!

Used my free time to read ahead the [[https://github.com/rafaelbeirigo/odin-css-exercises/tree/main/foundations/intro-to-css/03-grouping-selectors][next assignment]].
Let's get to it.
Done!
After 48 minutes.

For this exercise, I just went full LP, finished the assignment, and /only then/ commited the chunks.
It was much easier to get things flowing, but a little bit messier when dealing with text edits.
But I believe this is a nice approach.

** 04-chaining-selectors
This one was the quickest so far!
Again, LP, and then commit helped.

** 05-descendant-combinator
This was even quicker: 8 minutes!

And with it, I finished the first branch, =intro-to-css=!

[[file:images/2025-10-02_seinfeld.jpeg]]

* [2025-10-01 Wed]
Today started with some final polishing on the [[https://github.com/rafaelbeirigo/odin-recipes][Recipes Project]].

Writing the commits before coding was a success.
Very comforting to code when you know there's a light at the end of the tunnel, and no rework will be necessary (well, maybe /less/ work...)

Just found out that the [[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev][HTML Specification has a version for developers]].
Did some reading, nice stuff.
But potentially a rabbit hole.
Will focus on [[https://www.theodinproject.com/][Odin]].

Now, I start learning CSS!

The action is happening in my [[https://github.com/rafaelbeirigo/odin-css-exercises/blob/main/foundations/intro-to-css/01-css-methods/README.org][forked repo of the CSS Exercises]].

** Notes from today
- I'm clocking my work, and this is helping to keep me grounded, and also learn realistic timetable expectations;
- CSS is fun
- Literate Programming is really helpful to organize the work, especially so when I must leave the work half-finished, and come back later: it's faster to hit the ground running with LP

* [2025-09-30 Tue]
Back at it!

This new project felt too simple.
I kinda underestimated it and couldn't do something I wanted: a clean commit history from the beginning.
I'll try another approach today: write the commit messages /before/ coding.
Let's see how that goes.
(Still working on the [[https://github.com/rafaelbeirigo/odin-recipes][project Recipes from Odin]]).

Edit: You can see the final version of the page [[https://rafaelbeirigo.github.io/odin-recipes/][here]] (three recipes inspired on Harry Potter's books).

** Systems Thinking
Just heard about it this week.
I believe I applied it today.
I love it!

** Results: Writing the commits before coding
/Very/ helpful, much better!
Knowing that each task had a purpose, and that we would get to the final product was very empowering and calming.
I'd call it a success!

Back to HTML!

We're approaching a project on Odin!

Starting with Git.

Just learned about Commit Messages.

Next is a project, and then we start CSS.

** Digression on Git

I have been thinking about yesterday's work, with lots of refactoring, while porting to LP.
It was difficult to keep a clean commit history.

I believe the best way to accomplish it is by planning beforehand.
I have some ideas, that I will experiment with in this next project.

** Project: Recipes

[[file:images/2025-09-29_seinfeld.jpeg]]

* [2025-09-28 Sun]
Thought of doing some elisp coding this sunday.
I have this [[https://github.com/rafaelbeirigo/ma-github][project that creates Github repositories directly from inside Emacs]].
As they say: "Life is better when you don't have to leave your editor".

Last time I touched it was 3 years ago.

Today I thought of checking it out, seeing how it stands, and maybe hacking it a bit.
So, for this coding, all the action will happen  [[https://github.com/rafaelbeirigo/ma-github/commits/dev/][commit history for the dev branch of the repository of that project]].

This is how it went.

** Create a Github token
*** First try: Generate a classic token with all the powers
**** Generate
I just checked out if I had the repo in my machine, and it was there.

Then I followed the repo's instructions to run it.
You need an *access token*, and I had to create one.
The proccess was cryptic:
- You have to choose the powers of your token;
- I wanted the power to *create a repository*;
- I couldn't find that option there.


After getting scared by the implications of them insisting on an /expiration date/ for the token, I wanted to create the least powerful, but still useful token.
Invested a dozen minutes trying to read throught the docs, and then realized *I was going down a rabbit hole*.

Decided on just creating the most powerful token possible, with a very short expiration date---seven days (/The Ring/, anyone?).
The steps were:

1. Open the [[https://github.com/settings/tokens/new][page to generate a /Classic/ token]]
2. Put on *Note*: ma-github
3. On *Expiration*: 7 days
4. On *Select scopes*: select everything
5. Click *Generate token*
6. Copy the generated token and paste it on a safe place

**** Access from inside Emacs
Here I Needed some help from ChatGPT:

#+begin_quote
i want to have my Github token accessed by Emacs
How should I do it?
#+end_quote

Then ChatGPT inspired me to change gears.

*** Second try (ChatGPT): Generate a fine-grained token with minimal powers
**** Generate
1. Go to the [[https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens][Github page to generate a fine-grained token]]
2. Click *Generate new token*
3. *Token name*: ma-github
4. *Resource owner*: the Github account where the repositories will be created
5. *Expiration*: 30 days
6. *Repository access*: All repositories
7. *Permissions*
   1. Click the *+* button on the upper-right corner
   2. Select *Administration*
   3. Click outside of the selection thingy to make it disappear
   4. On the new item *Administration*, change from *Read-only* to *Read and write*
8. Click *Generate token*
9. Click *Generate token* again, on the pop-up window
10. Copy the token
11. Paste it somewhere safe

**** Access from inside Emacs

***** Set up *authinfo*

1. Follow this [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/keeping-secrets-in-emacs-gnupg-auth-sources][instructions to create =~/.authinfo.gpg~]]

   1. Create a key

      1. Open a terminal and run the command

         #+begin_src shell
         gpg --gen-key
         #+end_src

      2. Inform your real name and then your email

      3. It will generate a key in =~/.gnupg=

2. Create (or edit) the file =~/.authinfo.gpg= in Emacs. Use this format (one line per entry):

   #+begin_example
   machine api.github.com login YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME password <YOUR_TOKEN>
   #+end_example

3. Change the permissions of the file to make it more secure

   #+begin_src shell
   chmod 600 ~/.authinfo.gpg
   #+end_src

***** Fetch the token using *authinfo*

This code snippet uses the token created before to give =ma-github= access to Github.
It

1. Asks for a Github username, and then

2. Sets the environment variables needed by =ma-github=.

#+begin_src elisp
;; ensure auth-source uses the default backends (it does by default)
;; Here is a tiny helper that reads the token and (optionally) sets env var:

(require 'auth-source)

(defun ma-github-token-from-authinfo (&optional username)
  "Find a GitHub token from auth-source for api.github.com and return the secret string."
  (let* ((host "api.github.com")
         (user (or username user-login-name))
         (entry (car (auth-source-search :host host :user user :max 1))))
    (when entry
      (let ((secret (plist-get entry :secret)))
        (if (functionp secret) (funcall secret) secret)))))

;; optional: make token available to Emacs subprocesses (e.g. `curl` from Emacs)
(let* ((user (read-string "Github username: "))
       (tok (my/github-token-from-authinfo user)))
  (when user
    (setenv "MA_GITHUB_USER" tok))
  (when tok
    (setenv "MA_GITHUB_TOKEN" tok)))
#+end_src

Now let's try and create a repo with ma-github.

#+begin_quote
M-x ma-github-create
#+end_quote

And here is the [[https://github.com/rafaelbeirigo/hello-ma-github][Github repository created using ma-github]]!

Now let's integrate the *auth-source* functionality.

Timeline (I tried, but too distracting!):

1. [2025-09-28 Sun 13:13] Breaking the code down in LP blocks.

2. [2025-09-28 Sun 13:13] info on defun optional arguments

3. [...] All the action is on the [[https://github.com/rafaelbeirigo/ma-github/commits/dev/][commit history for the dev branch]].

4. [2025-09-28 Sun 21:02] Ported to LP and tested: (ma-github-create NAME)

I tried my best to be organized, but it's messy.
Next step is to reorganize the commits.
Not for /functionality/, but /learning/.

[2025-09-27 Sat 11:57] Pausing for lunch.

[2025-09-27 Sat 17:57] Coming back, after busking.

The Web is made out of links.
Let's add our first one.
We need to add an *anchor* element, and give it some attributes.
We'll leave a placeholder for the attributes.

~<<body Content odin-links-and-images>> +≡~

#+begin_src html :noweb-ref body Content odin-links-and-images :noweb-seb nil
<a
  <<attributes for Odin about page href>>
  >About the Odin Project.</a>
#+end_src

The first attribute contains the /link/ itself, and is called *href*.

~<<attributes for Odin about page href>> +≡~

#+begin_src html :noweb-ref attributes for Odin about page href
href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about"
#+end_src

The link now would open on the same tab.
Let's open in a new one, using the attribute *target*.

~<<attributes for Odin about page href>> +≡~

#+begin_src html :noweb-ref attributes for Odin about page href
target="_blank"
#+end_src

Now we add some security measures.
This new attribute and value prevents some dangers when linking to another page.
Possible attacks include phishing and tabnabbing.

** Seinfeld Checkmark
[[file:images/2025-09-27_seinfeld.jpeg]]

* [2025-09-26 Fri]
** Feel like snowballing.
Was drifting and rabbit-holling, as per usual
Checking out the [[https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard][Odin Project]], thought it was cool they also develop /character/.
Grit, resilience, and the rollercoaster to mastery were eye-openers to me.

Asked ChatGPT for help there.
Got realistic market analysis, criticism about main goal, specific roadmap with projects, and milestones.

Started applying the Seinfeld checkmarks.
I want to code a minimum of 1 hour every day.
Almost procrastinated until I bought a cool sheet with the squares, but ended up doing it by hand.

[[file:images/2025-09-26_seinfeld.jpeg]]

I really like those sites that allow you to code online.
Did 3 min of Exercism, elisp.
But then felt guilty, because I was derailing from the reading materials from Odin.
I want to code in other languages, besides JS.
I'll make sure to include them.
I want it to be also fun and enjoyable :)

Decided to turn this into a journal for accountability.
A bit of afraid this will derail me (happened in the past), but more confident on my resilience and emotional regulation skills this time.
Let's see.

Reading a lot of the initial material from Odin.
Decided on the Foundations.
Gonna follow this one---and *not* derail!
Need to feel secure about this.
But have to be careful about rabbit holes.

Personally, I tend to try to become a "specialist" on every detail.
Many times I don't get past the first stages of the learning process.
Journaling helps me a lot here.

Just opened a new issue on Odin's page.
I want to start collaborating.
It's a really easy one, but it's a start.

Just found out I goofed-up: the /real/ issue was my eagerness...
The issue is non-existant: I misread the text...
Well, one good opportunity to learn about this current personality trait!

Fitst session of the day ended.
Could finish all the initial readings and setup stuff.

Next: HTML!

** Odin recommended a site that has some JS.
Let's see if I remember it.
It's the code to sum two numbers.
It's a bit more complicated, because involves accessing the DOM.
Let's simplify it.
Just sum the contents of two variables, and assign it to another variable.

#+begin_src js
function sum (a, b) {
    let total = a + b;
    return total;
}
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
function NAME (ARGS) { STATEMENT; ... }
#+end_quote

And it returns with =return=.

Node.js is used to run JS in the server.

HTML: the page has *content*, which is enclosed in *tags*, forming *elements*.

An HTML tag is the markup language entity used to define elements with the content that will be shown on the page.

The element has
1. Opening tag;
2. Content;
3. Closing tag.


Void elements
- Don't have a closing tag; and
- Have no content.


We're coding, baby!

And W3 validate, baby!

I did some coding in HTML, and some debugging in Emacs.  Either Org or =noweb= were misbehaving.
Didn't know which though---I just restarted Emacs, and everything went back to normal.
Could apply the steps recommended by Odin for analyzing the problem, and it helped.

** 1h Coding, Hello World, HTML Boilerplate
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :session hello world
:END:
End of the day, after busking.
Kinda desperate that I didn't code today's 1h.
But there's plenty of time.
Thought of doing some elisp, but wanna focus on JS.

Let's try Exercism.
Can't really do the exercises without knowing the language, and don't think grinding on Exercism is a good use of my time.

Gonna go back to Odin, even if it is more /theory/ now.
There's hopefully some coding even now in the beginning.
If not, I'll reserve some time later and code elisp.

** Working with Text
*** Create a blog post
#+begin_quote
Create a plain blog article page which uses different headings, uses paragraphs, and has some text in the paragraphs bolded and italicized.

** First Seinfeld checkmark!
And this coding session warranted me my first one Seinfeld checkmark!

[[file:images/2025-09-26_seinfeld_checked.jpeg]]

* [2025-09-24 Wed]
So, we're learning Web Dev.
Well, at least /I/ am!

Let's make it easier and more fun with Literate Programming in Org Mode.

Starting from the fundamentals.
Web pages are all about navigating through content.
To make things easier, we have:
- HTML, for /structure/;
- CSS, for /style/;
- Javascript, for /logic/.


A minimal html page [[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com#writing][must have]]:

#+begin_src html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>
#+end_src

Here:
- ~<!DOCTYPE html>~ is the /Document Type Declaration/; it tells the browser the specifications that the page follows.
- ~<html>~ and ~</html>~ enclose the page itself.

The fundamental element of a web page is... well, an =element=.
By definition, an =element= is composed by (example inside the parentheses):
- opening tag (~<html>~);
- everything in between (called /content/);
- closing tag (~</html>~).

The page is made of a /sequence of elements/.

Some elements may be /empty/: they don't have a closing tag.
Example: ~<!DOCTYPE html>~.

A /cool/ first web page would be:

[[file:hello-world.html][hello-world.html]] ≡

#+begin_src html :tangle hello-world.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <p>Hello, World!</p>
</html>
#+end_src

*NOTE:* Here the /contents/ of the =element= ~<p>~ are "Hello, world!".

The ~<html>~ element contains all the elements of the whole page.
Only two tags should be immediately inside it: ~<head>~ and ~<body>~.
~<head>~ contains /metadata/; more about this below.
~<body>~ contains all the /visible/ elements of the page.

Then, each element of the page is either inside ~<head>~ or ~<body>~.
This is illustrated below.

#+begin_src
<html>
|
+- <head>
|
+- <body>
#+end_src

To help make things more clear, we'll call
- /Document/: the elements ~<!DOCTYPE>~ and ~<head>~ together, and
- /Page/: the ~<body>~ element.


For instance: ~hello-world.html~ contains the whole /document/.
When we open it on a browser, we see the (obviously /visible/) /page/, which is inside ~<body>~.

Let's then fix our first page!
It had a ~<p>~ element immediately inside ~<html>~, which is against the specs.
It must be inside ~<body>~.

We also have to add a ~<head>~ inside ~<html>~.
We could leave it empty, but that's not cool.
We'll put a ~<title>~ inside it.
~<title>~ is the /page/ title, that appears as the "name" of the browser window or the page's tab in the browser.

[[file:hello-world-fixed.html][hello-world-fixed.html]] ≡

#+begin_src html :tangle hello-world-fixed.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My first fixed page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello, World!</p>
  </body>
</html>
#+end_src

If you open both ~hello-world.html~ and ~hello-world-fixed.html~, you'll see that they look the same.
This shows how /forgiving/ HTML is.
It really tries to help us get there.
Good on you, HTML!

To help organizing paragraphs, we have /headings/.
They give us /six/ of them: ~<h1>~ to ~<h6>~.

[[file:headings.html][headings.html]] ≡

#+begin_src html :tangle headings.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Guess who my favorite was?</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>S.H.I.E.L.D. Team</h1>
    <h2>Nick Fury</h2>
    <p>Leading S.H.I.E.L.D. with an iron will and one eye on the bigger picture. He always anticipates threats before they happen. His presence commands respect across the superhero community. Nothing slips past his watchful eye.</p>

    <h2>Phil Coulson</h2>
    <p>The calm in the storm, proving loyalty is a superpower. Coulson bridges heroes and humans with tact and understanding. He carries a quiet strength that inspires trust. Even in chaos, his steady hand guides the team.</p>

    <h2>Maria Hill</h2>
    <p>Strategic, precise, and always ready for action. Hill can handle the toughest missions with clarity and focus. Her decisiveness keeps S.H.I.E.L.D. running smoothly. She never hesitates when lives are on the line.</p>

    <h2>Melinda May</h2>
    <p>The Cavalry—silent, deadly, and unstoppable. May’s combat skills are unmatched in the field. Beneath her stoic exterior lies fierce loyalty to her team. Every mission she undertakes is executed with perfection.</p>

    <h2>Leopold Fitz</h2>
    <p>Brains behind the tech, making the impossible possible. Fitz’s inventions often turn the tide in dire situations. His curiosity drives constant innovation. Even under pressure, his intellect shines brilliantly.</p>

    <h2>Skye</h2>
    <h3>Hacker</h3>
    <p>Skye starts out as a brilliant hacker, using her skills to uncover secrets and fight for justice from the shadows. Her curiosity and determination make her a force to be reckoned with. Even before joining S.H.I.E.L.D., she proves she can challenge the system.</p>

    <h3>Agent</h3>
    <p>Joining S.H.I.E.L.D., Skye becomes a trained field agent, learning to balance her intellect with physical skill. She adapts quickly to missions, proving her value to the team. Her loyalty and resourcefulness grow stronger with every challenge.</p>

    <h3>Daughter</h3>
    <p>Skye discovers her true identity as Daisy Johnson, the daughter of a powerful Inhuman. This revelation reshapes her understanding of herself and her powers. She struggles but ultimately embraces her heritage, gaining confidence and purpose.</p>

    <h3>Leader</h3>
    <p>Over time, Skye evolves into a capable leader, guiding missions and protecting her team. Her experience as both an outsider and a hero gives her unique insight. She inspires others through courage, empathy, and decisiveness.</p>

    <h3>Quake</h3>
    <p>Fully embracing her abilities, Skye becomes Quake, wielding seismic powers to combat threats. She balances heroism with personal growth, using her strength to defend the world. Quake is the culmination of her journey, symbolizing resilience, power, and identity.</p>
  </body>
</html>
#+end_src

Interesting to note that the paragraphs inside a heading are *not* nested inside it.

Now comes the ~<br>~ element.
It forces a line break in the text.
It is an /empty/ element, meaning it has no content.
This implies it does *not* need nor have an end tag.

In the example below, the poem has two versions: in the first one, the line breaks are only in the source code, and the second version /forces/ them with ~<br>~.
Only the second one gets the expected result (well, at least on a big screen).

[[file:br.html][br.html]] ≡

#+begin_src html :tangle br.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>br, but not for Brazil</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>He-Man stands tall, sword held high,
      Shadows flee where his heroes fly.
      In Eternia’s heart, he lights the night,
      Strength and courage his endless might.</p>

    <p>He-Man stands tall, sword held high,<br>
      Shadows flee where his heroes fly.<br>
      In Eternia’s heart, he lights the night,<br>
      Strength and courage his endless might.</p>
  </body>
</html>
#+end_src

Now is a good time to note that the tag names are case-insensitive.
Very sensible of forgiving HTML.
But (there's always one (well, not /always/)) *lowercase is recommended* in general and *demanded* for stricter document types like XHTML.
Let's keep it down low then.
