* [2025-09-27 Sat]
Starting later today.
Overslept.
Let's do this!

* [2025-09-26 Fri]
** Feel like snowballing.
Was drifting and rabbit-holling, as per usual
Checking out the [[https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard][Odin Project]], thought it was cool they also develop /character/.
Grit, resilience, and the rollercoaster to mastery were eye-openers to me.

Asked ChatGPT for help there.
Got realistic market analysis, criticism about main goal, specific roadmap with projects, and milestones.

Started applying the Seinfeld checkmarks.
I want to code a minimum of 1 hour every day.
Almost procrastinated until I bought a cool sheet with the squares, but ended up doing it by hand.

[[file:images/2025-09-26_seinfeld.jpeg]]

I really like those sites that allow you to code online.
Did 3 min of Exercism, elisp.
But then felt guilty, because I was derailing from the reading materials from Odin.
I want to code in other languages, besides JS.
I'll make sure to include them.
I want it to be also fun and enjoyable :)

Decided to turn this into a journal for accountability.
A bit of afraid this will derail me (happened in the past), but more confident on my resilience and emotional regulation skills this time.
Let's see.

Reading a lot of the initial material from Odin.
Decided on the Foundations.
Gonna follow this one---and *not* derail!
Need to feel secure about this.
But have to be careful about rabbit holes.

Personally, I tend to try to become a "specialist" on every detail.
Many times I don't get past the first stages of the learning process.
Journaling helps me a lot here.

Just opened a new issue on Odin's page.
I want to start collaborating.
It's a really easy one, but it's a start.

Just found out I goofed-up: the /real/ issue was my eagerness...
The issue is non-existant: I misread the text...
Well, one good opportunity to learn about this current personality trait!

Fitst session of the day ended.
Could finish all the initial readings and setup stuff.

Next: HTML!

** Odin recommended a site that has some JS.
Let's see if I remember it.
It's the code to sum two numbers.
It's a bit more complicated, because involves accessing the DOM.
Let's simplify it.
Just sum the contents of two variables, and assign it to another variable.

#+begin_src js
function sum (a, b) {
    let total = a + b;
    return total;
}
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
function NAME (ARGS) { STATEMENT; ... }
#+end_quote

And it returns with =return=.

Node.js is used to run JS in the server.

HTML: the page has *content*, which is enclosed in *tags*, forming *elements*.

An HTML tag is the markup language entity used to define elements with the content that will be shown on the page.

The element has
1. Opening tag;
2. Content;
3. Closing tag.


Void elements
- Don't have a closing tag; and
- Have no content.


We're coding, baby!

[[file:html-boilerplate/index.html][html-boilerplate/index.html]] ≡

#+begin_src html :tangle html-boilerplate/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <<head Block>>

  <<body Block>>
</html>
#+end_src

The =head= contains metadata and rendering instructions.
*No page content* here.
Always the first element inside =<html>=.

~<head Block> +≡~

#+begin_src html :noweb-ref head Block
<head>
  <<charset>>
  <<title>>
</head>
#+end_src

Let's make sure all glyphs show correctly.

~<<charset>> +≡~

#+begin_src html :noweb-ref charset
<meta charset="UTF-8">
#+end_src

Now the title.

~<<title>> +≡~

#+begin_src html :noweb-ref title
<title>My first page from Odin</title>
#+end_src

~<<body Block>> +≡~

#+begin_src html :noweb-ref body Block
<body>
  <<body Contents>>
</body>
#+end_src

Now add this to Emacs =web-mode=.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'web-mode-snippets
               '("my-odin-html-boilerplate"
                 "<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My first page from Odin</title>
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>
"))
#+end_src

~<<body Contents>> +≡~

#+begin_src html :noweb-ref body Contents
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
#+end_src

And W3 validate, baby!

I did some coding in HTML, and some debugging in Emacs.  Either Org or =noweb= were misbehaving.
Didn't know which though---I just restarted Emacs, and everything went back to normal.
Could apply the steps recommended by Odin for analyzing the problem, and it helped.

** 1h Coding, Hello World, HTML Boilerplate
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :session hello world
:END:
End of the day, after busking.
Kinda desperate that I didn't code today's 1h.
But there's plenty of time.
Thought of doing some elisp, but wanna focus on JS.

Let's try Exercism.
Can't really do the exercises without knowing the language, and don't think grinding on Exercism is a good use of my time.

Gonna go back to Odin, even if it is more /theory/ now.
There's hopefully some coding even now in the beginning.
If not, I'll reserve some time later and code elisp.

** Working with Text
*** Create a blog post
#+begin_quote
Create a plain blog article page which uses different headings, uses paragraphs, and has some text in the paragraphs bolded and italicized.
You can use Lorem Ipsum to generate dummy text, in place of real text as you build your sites.
#+end_quote

** First Seinfeld checkmark!
And this coding session warranted me my first one Seinfeld checkmark!

[[file:images/2025-09-26_seinfeld_checked.jpeg]]

* [2025-09-24 Wed]
So, we're learning Web Dev.
Well, at least /I/ am!

Let's make it easier and more fun with Literate Programming in Org Mode.

Starting from the fundamentals.
Web pages are all about navigating through content.
To make things easier, we have:
- HTML, for /structure/;
- CSS, for /style/;
- Javascript, for /logic/.


A minimal html page [[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com#writing][must have]]:

#+begin_src html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
</html>
#+end_src

Here:
- ~<!DOCTYPE html>~ is the /Document Type Declaration/; it tells the browser the specifications that the page follows.
- ~<html>~ and ~</html>~ enclose the page itself.

The fundamental element of a web page is... well, an =element=.
By definition, an =element= is composed by (example inside the parentheses):
- opening tag (~<html>~);
- everything in between (called /content/);
- closing tag (~</html>~).

The page is made of a /sequence of elements/.

Some elements may be /empty/: they don't have a closing tag.
Example: ~<!DOCTYPE html>~.

A /cool/ first web page would be:

[[file:hello-world.html][hello-world.html]] ≡

#+begin_src html :tangle hello-world.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <p>Hello, World!</p>
</html>
#+end_src

*Note*: Here the /contents/ of the =element= ~<p>~ are "Hello, world!".

The ~<html>~ element contains all the elements of the whole page.
Only two tags should be immediately inside it: ~<head>~ and ~<body>~.
~<head>~ contains /metadata/; more about this below.
~<body>~ contains all the /visible/ elements of the page.

Then, each element of the page is either inside ~<head>~ or ~<body>~.
This is illustrated below.

#+begin_src
<html>
|
+- <head>
|
+- <body>
#+end_src

To help make things more clear, we'll call
- /Document/: the elements ~<!DOCTYPE>~ and ~<head>~ together, and
- /Page/: the ~<body>~ element.


For instance: ~hello-world.html~ contains the whole /document/.
When we open it on a browser, we see the (obviously /visible/) /page/, which is inside ~<body>~.

Let's then fix our first page!
It had a ~<p>~ element immediately inside ~<html>~, which is against the specs.
It must be inside ~<body>~.

We also have to add a ~<head>~ inside ~<html>~.
We could leave it empty, but that's not cool.
We'll put a ~<title>~ inside it.
~<title>~ is the /page/ title, that appears as the "name" of the browser window or the page's tab in the browser.

[[file:hello-world-fixed.html][hello-world-fixed.html]] ≡

#+begin_src html :tangle hello-world-fixed.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My first fixed page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello, World!</p>
  </body>
</html>
#+end_src

If you open both ~hello-world.html~ and ~hello-world-fixed.html~, you'll see that they look the same.
This shows how /forgiving/ HTML is.
It really tries to help us get there.
Good on you, HTML!

To help organizing paragraphs, we have /headings/.
They give us /six/ of them: ~<h1>~ to ~<h6>~.

[[file:headings.html][headings.html]] ≡

#+begin_src html :tangle headings.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Guess who my favorite was?</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>S.H.I.E.L.D. Team</h1>
    <h2>Nick Fury</h2>
    <p>Leading S.H.I.E.L.D. with an iron will and one eye on the bigger picture. He always anticipates threats before they happen. His presence commands respect across the superhero community. Nothing slips past his watchful eye.</p>

    <h2>Phil Coulson</h2>
    <p>The calm in the storm, proving loyalty is a superpower. Coulson bridges heroes and humans with tact and understanding. He carries a quiet strength that inspires trust. Even in chaos, his steady hand guides the team.</p>

    <h2>Maria Hill</h2>
    <p>Strategic, precise, and always ready for action. Hill can handle the toughest missions with clarity and focus. Her decisiveness keeps S.H.I.E.L.D. running smoothly. She never hesitates when lives are on the line.</p>

    <h2>Melinda May</h2>
    <p>The Cavalry—silent, deadly, and unstoppable. May’s combat skills are unmatched in the field. Beneath her stoic exterior lies fierce loyalty to her team. Every mission she undertakes is executed with perfection.</p>

    <h2>Leopold Fitz</h2>
    <p>Brains behind the tech, making the impossible possible. Fitz’s inventions often turn the tide in dire situations. His curiosity drives constant innovation. Even under pressure, his intellect shines brilliantly.</p>

    <h2>Skye</h2>
    <h3>Hacker</h3>
    <p>Skye starts out as a brilliant hacker, using her skills to uncover secrets and fight for justice from the shadows. Her curiosity and determination make her a force to be reckoned with. Even before joining S.H.I.E.L.D., she proves she can challenge the system.</p>

    <h3>Agent</h3>
    <p>Joining S.H.I.E.L.D., Skye becomes a trained field agent, learning to balance her intellect with physical skill. She adapts quickly to missions, proving her value to the team. Her loyalty and resourcefulness grow stronger with every challenge.</p>

    <h3>Daughter</h3>
    <p>Skye discovers her true identity as Daisy Johnson, the daughter of a powerful Inhuman. This revelation reshapes her understanding of herself and her powers. She struggles but ultimately embraces her heritage, gaining confidence and purpose.</p>

    <h3>Leader</h3>
    <p>Over time, Skye evolves into a capable leader, guiding missions and protecting her team. Her experience as both an outsider and a hero gives her unique insight. She inspires others through courage, empathy, and decisiveness.</p>

    <h3>Quake</h3>
    <p>Fully embracing her abilities, Skye becomes Quake, wielding seismic powers to combat threats. She balances heroism with personal growth, using her strength to defend the world. Quake is the culmination of her journey, symbolizing resilience, power, and identity.</p>
  </body>
</html>
#+end_src

Interesting to note that the paragraphs inside a heading are *not* nested inside it.

Now comes the ~<br>~ element.
It forces a line break in the text.
It is an /empty/ element, meaning it has no content.
This implies it does *not* need nor have an end tag.

In the example below, the poem has two versions: in the first one, the line breaks are only in the source code, and the second version /forces/ them with ~<br>~.
Only the second one gets the expected result (well, at least on a big screen).

[[file:br.html][br.html]] ≡

#+begin_src html :tangle br.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>br, but not for Brazil</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>He-Man stands tall, sword held high,
      Shadows flee where his heroes fly.
      In Eternia’s heart, he lights the night,
      Strength and courage his endless might.</p>

    <p>He-Man stands tall, sword held high,<br>
      Shadows flee where his heroes fly.<br>
      In Eternia’s heart, he lights the night,<br>
      Strength and courage his endless might.</p>
  </body>
</html>
#+end_src

Now is a good time to note that the tag names are case-insensitive.
Very sensible of forgiving HTML.
But (there's always one (well, not /always/)) *lowercase is recommended* in general and *demanded* for stricter document types like XHTML.
Let's keep it down low then.
